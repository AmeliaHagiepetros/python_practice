# python_practice

Here is some general work I will be working on as I continue on my journey of improving my python skills! Some have been previous projects, some are new. 

Note: although the code is techinically runnable, some may refer to CSVs that I will not be adding to the file(currently) and so may not run properly if copied elsewhere. Thanks!
